Combine all PER-PLATE POOLS (Low concentration + 1/10 high concentration) and concentrate
    - combine volumes into a new tube 
    - add 1103.16 µL SPRI beads.
    - Mix on tube rotator 10 minutes
    - remove supernatant and wash 2x with 80% EtOH
    - Dry and elute in 52.59 µL H2O or Tris.

You should now have 52.59 µL at approximately 5.00 ng/µL.
